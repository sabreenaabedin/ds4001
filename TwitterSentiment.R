## Here we perform some sentiment analysis:

## Below is a function that scores sentiment on a scale of -5 to 5 (-5 being the most negative
## and 5 being the most positive).  A score is determined for each tweet based on its correlation
## with the positive words and the negative words.  This is original code written by a veteran R
##user that functions as part of an old package called "sentiment" that is no longer available.

{
  require(plyr)
  require(stringr)
  
  # we got a vector of sentences. plyr will handle a list or a vector as an "l" for us
  # we want a simple array of scores back, so we use "l" + "a" + "ply" = laply:
  scores = laply(sentences, function(sentence, pos.words, neg.words) {
    
    # clean up sentences with R's regex-driven global substitute, gsub():
    sentence = gsub('[[:punct:]]', '', sentence)
    sentence = gsub('[[:cntrl:]]', '', sentence)
    sentence = gsub('\\d+', '', sentence)
    # and convert to lower case:
    sentence = tolower(sentence)
    
    # split into words. str_split is in the stringr package
    word.list = str_split(sentence, '\\s+')
    # sometimes a list() is one level of hierarchy too much
    words = unlist(word.list)
    
    # compare our words to the dictionaries of positive & negative terms
    pos.matches = match(words, pos.words)
    neg.matches = match(words, neg.words)
    
    # match() returns the position of the matched term or NA
    # we just want a TRUE/FALSE:
    pos.matches = !is.na(pos.matches)
    neg.matches = !is.na(neg.matches)
    
    # and conveniently enough, TRUE/FALSE will be treated as 1/0 by sum():
    score = sum(pos.matches) - sum(neg.matches)
    
    return(score)
  }, pos.words, neg.words, .progress=.progress )
  
  scores.df = data.frame(score=scores, text=sentences)
  return(scores.df)
}

## Now apply the function to our actual data.  

Score <- score.sentiment(some_txt,positives,negatives,.progress='none')

## Score has two fields: score and text.  We 
## are interested in score at this point, but we can look at a few of the tweets' text and
## the associated score first.

head(Score)

## Letâ€™s plot a histogram of the sentiment score:
  
hist(Score$score,xlab="Sentiment Score ",main="Sentiment of sample tweets that have Trump in them ",
       border="black",col="skyblue")

## We can calculate overall sentiment by adding together all of the scores:

sum(Score$score)
 
## Finally, you can convert to a document term matrix and look for frequencies and associations:

text.corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(some_txt))
dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(text.corpus)
